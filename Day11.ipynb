    "- Starting items lists your worry level for each item the monkey is currently holding in the order they will be inspected.\n",
    "- Operation shows how your worry level changes as that monkey inspects an item. (An operation like new = old * 5 means that your worry level after the monkey inspected the item is five times whatever your worry level was before inspection.)\n",

Monkey 0 goes first, then monkey 1, and so on until each monkey has had one turn. The process of each monkey taking a single turn is called a round.\n",

A monkey that starts a round with no items could end up inspecting and throwing many items by the time its turn comes around.
