Notes:
    Day 11:  Not enough compute power to complete part II.  May come back later to see if I can optimize and solve.
    
    Day 12:  Not sure how to implement a solution for this one.
    
    Day 13:  Back in the win column!  Part I was tough, but part II only took another couple minutes
    
    Day 14:  Might come back to part I
